# ENIAC-II Discount Analysis
Part 2 of the project is to work with clean data or not corrupted with missing values or typos. 

# How is it looking? 
At this time our main question to answer is "Should ENIAC continue providing discounts in order to gain a higher revenue?" 
The data we are working with has many paths we could follow for the analysis.

From the beginning, if you follow the code, our efforts are focused on the products sold (quantities) and thier descriptions. 
However, as we continue not to see a pattern for the analysis, it was decided to create product categories and price categories to undestand better how the discounts affect sales and revenue.
As we try to zoom in from categories into brands and products, we continue to filter time as in overall, quarters, months, and seasons.

# Our recommendations:
Targeted Discounting: Instead of broad discounts.
Seasonal promotions rather than constant discounting.
Maintain premium pricing on core products like apple.
Offer discounts on complementary items. For cross selling.
Use data-driven decisions for discount timing and depth.
